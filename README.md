# DNA Sequence bonding prediction with Kernel

The goal of this work is to use kernel algorithm to classify is a DNA is bound or not with
a transcription factor. We apply standard kernel (quadratic, linear, ...) and implement some
specific for sequential data (spectrum, mismatch). The results show that the good choice of the
kernel is very important to get a good performance.
Keywords: kernel, DNA, classification
